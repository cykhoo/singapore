## Meetups

RubySG meetups are held once a month, on a Tuesday.

For updates on the latest meetup, please check us out on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/).

## Data SIM Card

At changi airport (currency exchange counter) you could buy a $15 (5 days) / $30 (10 days) Singtel Prepaid SIM Card with 100G data.

[![screenshot 2015-06-02 17 05 02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1000669/7932264/8d5d801a-0949-11e5-921e-54f9526a9153.png)](http://info.singtel.com/personal/phones-plans/mobile/prepaid/hitouristsimcards)

You can go into most convenience stores (eg. 7-11) and buy a pre-paid simcard
from either SingTel or StarHub (or possibly M1).

[SingTel plans](http://info.singtel.com/personal/phones-plans/mobile/singtel-prepaid)
and
[StarHub plans](http://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/prepaid-plans.html).

You are very unlikely to find a nano format simcard however, which means you
should look for a phone store.

Looks like [this is the card](https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10152525153311677)
to get for those who need nano sims.

## Power (Socket)

This [bad boy](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm) (Type G, BS 1363 UK, 230-240V).

Sometimes you can force the two prong [European Type C](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeC.htm)
into the socket, but it involves shoving a something small and non-metallic into the third hole, so I
tend to avoid using this one.

## Free WiFi

Changi Airport has it.

[Comment: Changi Airport is *amazing*. I returned from a trip one day and to
get from the gate, through customs and into a taxi took FOUR minutes.]

Wireless@SG is an open network available at almost every shopping mall, library and McDonalds.
Requires a log in. [Sign up here, under "Non-Singtel Customers"](http://info.singtel.com/personal/internet/broadband-on-the-go/wireless-sg). There is also a second network SSID called Wireless@SGx, which uses WPA-Enterprise + TKIP for authentication.

And the reboutable ladyironchef [lays down](http://www.ladyironchef.com/2013/08/cafes-free-wifi-singapore/)
where the free wifi cafes are.

## Tipping

No real need to tip. Leave a few coins if you'd like (to get rid of your coins).

You don't need to tip at a hawker food stall, and normal restaurants include a
10% service charge.

[Comment: Oh and talking about coins, Singapore is in a transition from one set
of coins to another differently sized set. So you'll get two sizes of each
coin. Yay!]

## Tissue Culture

Singaporeans often leave tissues on seats in busy food halls (hawker centres
etc.) while they walk around and buy food. I know you'll be tempted but best
not to remove the tissue and sit down.

[Comment: If you need your own tissues, hawker centres are the place to buy
them. You'll often find an older gentleman or lady offering one, two or more
packets for a dollar or two.]

## Communication

English mainly.
[Singlish](http://www.aussiepete.com/2008/05/singlish-language-guide-for-foreigners.html).

[Comment: You'll look like an idiot if you try this slang. I sometimes answer
"are you able to?" questions with "can!", but mostly that just makes me look
like an idiot. YMMV.]

## What to buy to bring back home

- Bak Kwa
  For those who like their pork. Just walk into any
  [Bee Cheng Hiang](http://www.beechenghiang.com.sg/our-story/our-bakkwa.html) or [Lim Chee Guan](http://www.limcheeguan.com.sg/)
- Pandan Cake or Kueh Lapis from Bengawan Solo
  Conveniently they have [outlets at Changi Airport](http://www.changiairport.com/shopping-and-dining/shopping/bengawan-solo).
- Pineapple cakes from [Sunny Hills](http://www.sunnyhills.com.sg/stores.php)
- Kaya Jam and Kopi powder from [Ya Kun](http://yakun.com/menu/merchandise)

## Don'ts

- Vandalism
- Littering
- Chewing gum
  [Comment: Actually you can chew gum like a cow chews cud, but you won't be
  able to buy any gum in Singapore and when you need to get rid of your gum,
  make sure you put it in a bin - see "littering" above.]
- Don't carry [Durian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian) in public transport
  [Comment: Eating Durian is another must-try experience in Singapore. However, carrying them in public transport is a fineable offense. If you really want to carry it onto public transport, mention it to the sellers and they will make sure it's wrapped thoroughly so that the smell does not escape).

[Comment: You *really* don't want to commit even minor crimes here. Singapore
takes its law and order very seriously - one of the reasons it's a very nice
place to live.]

## Getting Around

Public transport in Singapore is excellent (see below) and probably should be
your first choice.

If you're in the central area you can certainly get to many places by walking
(but of course it's always hot and humid - and sometimes raining heavily - so
please take this into account).

### Taxi

Install one of the following apps:
- GrabTaxi
- Uber
- EasyTaxi

You can also walk to a Taxi stand or flag down a taxi from the street.

Taxis could be a challenge during raining days.

### MRT and Buses

The public transport system runs on a reloadable contactless card called EZ-Link. There are 1, 2, and 3 day unlimited "Tourist" passes. There is no need to buy these unless you plan on making 4+ trips per day.

There are the [MRT trains](http://www.smrt.com.sg/Trains/NetworkMap.aspx) which
are frequent, clean and fast (and *full* of people during rush hour). (They run
underground in the central part of Singapore.)

There are the [buses](http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/) which go everywhere, and
are also very clean and comfortable.

There are two apps that you might find helpful for getting around on the public
transport system:

- SBS Transit iris ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/sbs-transit-iris/id429899929), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.com.sbstransit.irisdroid))

  Tells you when the next bus will (hopefully) arrive.

- gothere.sg ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/gothere.sg/id348131804), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hema.gothere.sg))

  Tells you which bus or MRT to take to get from A to B.

Changi Airport has a MRT station at Terminal 2 and it takes about 45 min to get
into town. You take the train past expo which ends at Tanah Merah, then you
wait for a green line train *from* Pasir Ris *towards* Joo Koon. This then
takes you into the central area (probably City Hall or Raffles Place - don't go
all the way to Joo Koon!).

## Food

These are some of the local food that you should try if you are in Singapore.

[Comment: I've added photos for a few of the foods listed here, mostly the ones I've tried in Singapore.
If you're interested in some of the others, just grab a staff member at RDRC for suggestions about where to find them.]

### ieat Ultimate Food Trail

You can't go wrong following the recommendations of [famous food blogger Dr Leslie Tay](http://ieatishootipost.sg/).

Check out his [Singapore's Ultimate Food Trail post](http://bit.ly/ieatUltimateFoodTrail) and the [map](http://bit.ly/ieatUltimateFoodTrailmap).

### Kaya Toast with Eggs

[Yakun](http://www.yakun.com.sg/) - these stores are everywhere.

You can get this at the drink stall in almost every hawker center. Ask for "breakfast set".

### Nasi Lemak

This is a traditional Malays dish of chicken, rice and other nice things.

[Comment: Sorry, but I haven't found a really good Nasi Lemak in Singapore.]

### Carrot Cake

Go into any hawker centre and you'll find carrot cake. There are two varieties,
black and white.

### Popiah

A spicy roll and a great option for vegetarians.

![Popiah](/images/popiah.jpg)

### Chicken Rice

This is a very famous Singaporean dish.

Tian Tian in the Maxwell Food Centre is very famous (and I hear half decent).
If you like to stand in a long queue, please go there at lunch. If you don't go
there at lunch, they're unlikely to be open.

### Ice Kacang

A local dessert.

![Ais Bor](/images/ais_bor.jpg)

[Comment: Unfortunately Singapore just doesn't make good variations of this
dessert. You need to visit Malaysia for the real thing.]

### Tsui Kway / Chwee Kueh

This is an odd one, again from hawker centres. Rice cakes sprinkled with salted radish.

[Comment: I *think* it's vegetarian.]

### Laksa

Spicy noodle soup.

### Bak Kut Teh

Pork in a herb soup..

### Rojak

Rojak is a great local dish for vegetarians. Another staple of any food centre.

### Dim Sum

Not a traditional Singaporean dish but always a good option.

The most popular Hong Kong style dim sum (aka. yum cha) restaurant at the
moment is [Tim Ho Wan](http://www.timhowan.com/locate-us/) - their pork buns
are a "must try".

![Pork Buns](/images/tim_ho_wan_pork_buns.jpg)

### Kway Chap

Kway Chap is a Teochew dish of flat, broad rice sheets in a soup made with dark soy sauce, served with pig offal, braised duck meat, various kinds of beancurd, preserved salted vegetables, and braised hard-boiled eggs. Fit for the slightly adventurous!

[Pictures of Kway Chap via Google](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=kway+chap+singapore&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=rRiqU7e_CsmHuAS3yYGQBA&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1916&bih=986)

### Chilli Crab

Singapore is very famous for its chilli crab.

If you can get there
[Mellben](https://www.facebook.com/MellbenSeafoodToaPayoh) is quite good. Try
their Crab Bee Hoon.]

[Comment: Don't try this at touristy restaurants - it's just not worth it.]

### Wanton Noodles

Again, not a truly local dish, but a very nice Chinese dish of noodles and
pork.

Worth visiting [Foong Kee Coffee Shop](http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/foong_kee/)
if you're in Chinatown.

![Wanton Min](/images/wanton_min.jpg)

## Coffee Culture

While there are many western-style cafes and popular chains like Starbucks throughout the island, local coffee culture is something you must experience. Best places to try local coffee are neighbourhood confectionaries or hawker centers. In local lingo, coffee is known as Kopi (and tea is Teh for that matter). There's a comprehensive vocabulary developed on how to order coffee (it is fun to learn and great way to immerse).

You can learn more about Kopi lingo from [KopiJS](http://www.kopijs.org). They also have a regular meetup, which you can join for kopi adventures and meet interesting people.

## Cat Cafes

> Time spent with cats is never wasted.

* [Meomi Cat Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/meomicatcafe)
* [Cat Cafe Neko no Niwa](http://www.catcafe.com.sg)
* [The Cat Cafe Singapore](http://thecatcafe.sg)

## Drinking Locations

- Club Street
- Clarke Quay
  [Comment: If you like local beers, [The Pump Room](http://www.pumproomasia.com/)
  at Clarke Quay is worth visiting to try their ales.]

Of course there will be many other places that people drink in Singapore, just
ask someone at RDRC for recommendations.

### Singapore Sling

This is an alcoholic drink. I've never tried it but I'm sure it has a lot of
booze in it.

The quintessential place to drink it is at Raffles Hotel (in the public area),
but very expensive.

## Major Hawker Centres

[Maxwell Food Centre](https://plus.google.com/116782628772913980144/about?gl=sg&hl=en)
- ABC Market
- Redhill

## Shopping

One of the two major passions (the other being eating) of Singaporeans.

###Electronics

- Sim Lim Square

  Good for electronics, lower floors specialise in audio, video and cameras. Shop around for the best prices and check warranties before plonking down your hard-earned cash. Some bargaining may be possible.
	
  Nearest MRT station: Bugis (East West and Downtown Lines)

- Sim Lim Tower
  
  Electronic components and spare parts. Nerd paradise.

- Funan Square

  Slightly more up-market version of Sim Lim Square. Prices probably higher than Sim Lim, but comes with an altogether more pleasant shopping experience. Challenger mega-store on top floor.
  
  Nearest MRT stations: City Hall (East West and North South Lines), Clarke Quay (North East Line)

## Sight Seeing

- Bugis Street
- National Museum
  [Comment: It's a nice old building but not that exciting unless you're really into
  museums.]
- Marina Bay Sands
- Singapore Zoo
- Night Safari
- River Safari
- Bird Park
- Sentosa
- Universal Studios
- Merlion
- Orchard Road
- Sky Garden
- Singapore Flyer
- River Cruise
- F1 Race Track
- Botanic Gardens
- Macritchie Reservoir
- Henderson Park
- China Town
- Haji Lane
- Pulau Ubin
- Bukit Timah Hill
- Gardens By the Bay
  [Comment: Enclosed and air conditioned gardens. Quite impressive unless you have to go
  there more than once.]

## Currency

It's advisable to bring [Singapore dollars
(SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_dollar) when visiting. However
you can easily get cash out when you arive if nessary. While credit cards are
widely accepted here, there are plenty of places which will only take cash.
Certainly for public transport, cash is more heavily used. The best local food
can be found in the older [hawker centres](#major-hawker-centres) and can't be
bought with a credit card.

Some retailers have a naughty habit of slapping on surcharges for credit
card purchases, so, if you're shopping for say electronic goods, you might find
that you get a small "discount" for paying by cash.

VISA and MasterCard are commonly accepted. Many retailers still don't accept
AMEX. Some retailers accept Discover, but best to assume most don't.
